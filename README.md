This project provides a complete deep-learning-based system for detecting brain tumors from CT scan images. It includes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) training pipeline built using TensorFlow/Keras, and an interactive web application developed with Flask that allows users to upload CT scan images and receive model predictions along with a Grad-CAM visualization. The goal of the project is to make brain tumor detection more accessible by combining machine learning with an easy-to-use web interface, while also offering model interpretability through heatmap-based explanations.

The model is trained on a dataset containing brain CT scan images categorized into “Healthy” and “Tumor” classes. During training, the dataset is augmented with transformations such as rotation, zooming, shifting, shearing, and horizontal flipping to improve model generalization. The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional and max-pooling layers for hierarchical feature extraction, followed by dense layers for classification. The model uses the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss, and the best-performing model is automatically saved during training using the ModelCheckpoint callback. EarlyStopping is also implemented to avoid overfitting by monitoring validation accuracy.

After training, the final model is saved as cnn_model_final.keras and loaded into the Flask application. The web app allows users to upload CT scan images in common formats such as JPG, PNG, or JPEG. Once an image is uploaded, it is preprocessed and passed through the CNN model to generate a prediction along with a confidence score. To enhance safety, a confidence threshold restricts low-confidence tumor predictions, reducing false positives. In addition to the prediction, the application generates a Grad-CAM heatmap that visually highlights the regions of the CT scan that influenced the model’s decision. This provides transparency by helping users understand how the model interpreted the image.

The Flask app includes robust error handling for model loading, image format validation, file processing, and prediction failures. Uploaded images and generated Grad-CAM images are stored in an uploads directory, ensuring smooth operation during user interaction. The application runs locally, and once launched, users can easily access it through a browser to test CT scan images for tumor detection.

To use the project, you first need to train the model using the included training script. This requires placing the dataset inside the designated folder and executing the training code. After the model is generated, it can be used directly by running the Flask app. The project folder structure includes the training script, the Flask app, the model directory, an uploads directory, and templates for rendering the web pages.

Overall, this project demonstrates a complete pipeline—from data preprocessing and model training to real-time interactive inference and interpretability—making it a useful tool for educational purposes, research exploration, and experimentation with medical imaging AI systems.
